# ChatMeApp

## [Demo](https://lucianmurmurache.github.io/ChatMeApp/) coming soon!

## Summary:
After switching focus to collaboration and project management recently, I began with an introduction to native mobile applications. A deep dive into React Native, learning about its advantages and comparing it to React. Using a whole new CLI tool called [Expo](https://expo.io/) to set up my React Native project. Finally, I learned how to use Android emulators and iOS simulators to see how the app looks and behaves in different environments, before setting up and creating the layout for this project, a native mobile app!

### Installation instructions

To run the app, you must first install [expo](https://expo.io/). You can do this by running:

#### npm install expo-cli -g

### Required Libraries

To install all dependencies, you can run:

expo install react-navigation react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens npm install react-navigation-stack --save

Next, you can start app by running npm start . This will launch DevTools on port 19002. Now you can run the app on a physical device or emulator by either scanning the QR code or by creating and signing in an expo account. To run the app on your device, you can download and install the expo app from the app store or play store.

For information on how to set up an emulator for testing, you can visit the documentation [page](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).
