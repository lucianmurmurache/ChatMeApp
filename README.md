# ChatMeUp

## [Demo](https://lucianmurmurache.github.io/ChatMeApp/) coming soon!

## Summary:
After switching focus to collaboration and project management recently, I began with an introduction to native mobile applications. A deep dive into React Native, learning about its advantages and comparing it to React. Using a whole new CLI tool called Expo to set up my React Native project. Finally, I learned how to use Android emulators and iOS simulators to see how the app looks and behaves in different environments, before setting up and creating the layout for this project, a native mobile app!
